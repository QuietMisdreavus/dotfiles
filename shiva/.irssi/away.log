07:05 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/benhg8/>g ebut ofc you aren't allowed to make a twitter client that doesnt display ads or w/e, so
07:05 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/benhg8/>g etzaeru: yeah im not saying twitter is bad here
07:05 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/nagisa_mg8/>g etwitter could work just fine without javascript and it uses javascript therefore it is bad
07:06 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/nagisa_mg8/>g etzaeru: twitter mobile native app is pretty good
07:06 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/benhg8/>g ei think theres some people with js-less web twitter clients tho if youre specifically and not just aesthetically into that
07:07 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/tzaerug8/>g enagisa_m, I mean twitter.
07:07 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/nagisa_mg8/>g ebenh: I might or might not have been referring to the app by Twitter Inc :)
07:08 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/benhg8/>g eI'd definitely prefer a js-less twitter for backreading btw
07:08 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/tzaerug8/>g eI mean, if twitter now decided that they don't actually need JS and will not have it, they'd prolly lose a ton of users :P on the other hand if they decided to start supporting JSless version of the site, they'd just increase dev burden for the benefit of what, 0.01% of customers?
07:09 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/benhg8/>g eat least mobile twitter breaks the one benefit of infinite scroll that i could get behind, which is ctrl-f across the entire loaded buffer
07:09 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/nagisa_mg8/>g etzaeru: they'd release a for-once sane native client for 3 platforms and everybody would pay twitter to use it

17:11 #rust-beginners: 8/<g>/U_007Dg8/>g emisdreavus-- thank you--that's helpful.  The only misleading part is the compiler effectively said "expected &str, found str in one place, and expected &&str, found &str" in another, for the same error.  I didn't know which was true, and I was debugging the wrong message.  How should I interpret the error message?

15:04 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/projektirg8/>g eticki: I mean, if Twitter promotes bubbling but other things don't, you could be thinking you're seeing overall bubbles, while you're just seeing side effects of Twitter.

21:31 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/WindowsBunnyg8/>g emisdreavus: The basic problem is that when you're writing FFI bindings, you sometimes have to make breaking changes to *fix* the bindings
21:32 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/WindowsBunnyg8/>g emisdreavus: Here it's just a constant has an awkward type, but often in winapi a function will have the *wrong* signature
21:33 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/WindowsBunnyg8/>g emisdreavus: Like, I have to fix it in the current major version so that people don't hit bugs
21:33 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/WindowsBunnyg8/>g emisdreavus: But at the same time that violates semver
21:33 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/WindowsBunnyg8/>g emisdreavus: also, libc is *tiny* compared to winapi
21:34 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/WindowsBunnyg8/>g emisdreavus: libc/src is 673 KB
21:35 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/WindowsBunnyg8/>g emisdreavus: winapi/src + winapi/lib (stuff that *will* be in src soon) is 3.28MB and there's practically no duplication
21:37 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/WindowsBunnyg8/>g emisdreavus: On the bright side I only have *one* canonical source of information, the latest version of the Windows SDK
21:38 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/WindowsBunnyg8/>g emisdreavus: However, winapi is also tiny compared to the actual headers which are over 200MB
21:39 #rust-offtopic: 8/<g>/WindowsBunnyg8/>g emisdreavus: buuuut, thanks to have concise the Rust bindings are, I compared equivalent headers to their bindings and I'm saving approximately an order of magnitude
